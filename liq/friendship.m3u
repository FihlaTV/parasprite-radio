Dear Princess Celestia, I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings. But when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Applebuck Season":say:Applebuck Season. My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help she finds it hard to accept it. So while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Griffon the Brush Off":say:Griffon the Brush Off. Dearest Princess Celestia, Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Boast Busters":say:Boast Busters. Dear Princess Celestia, I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off, especially when you're standing up for your friends.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Dragonshy":say:Dragonshy. Dear Princess Celestia, I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend Fluttershy who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears. Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Look Before You Sleep":say:Look Before You Sleep. Dear Princess Celestia, It's hard to believe that two ponies that seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all...
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Bridle Gossip":say:Bridle Gossip. Dear Princess Celestia, My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the contents of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Swarm of the Century":say:Swarm of the Century. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives... Even when they don't always seem to make sense...
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Winter Wrap Up":say:Winter Wrap Up. Dear Princess Celestia, Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn that we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent we're sure to find them. And as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything...

Dearest Princess Celestia, I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are...

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Suited For Success":say:Suited For Success. Dear Princess Celestia, This week my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you oftentimes end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. And I learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, ha ha ha.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Sonic Rainboom":say:Sonic Rainboom. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: A Dog and Pony Show":say:A Dog and Pony Show. Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Green Isn't Your Color":say:Green Isn't Your Color. Dear Princess Celestia, Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret, but you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Over a Barrel":say:Over a Barrel. Dear Princess Celestia, Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care. And like the path cut through the orchard, there'll always be a way through.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: A Bird in the Hoof":say:A Bird in the Hoof. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: The Cutie Mark Chronicles":say:The Cutie Mark Chronicles. Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned something amazing! Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows, maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Owl's Well That Ends Well":say:Owl's Well That Ends Well. Dear Princess Celestia, This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week, I learned that being jealous, and telling lies, gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So, from here on out, I promise that I, Spike, will-
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 1",title="Friendship lesson: Party of One":say:Party of One. Dear Princess Celestia, I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Lesson Zero":say:Lesson Zero. Dear Princess Celestia, we're writin' to you today because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship. We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously. Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about. And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem, into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem! Signed, your loyal subjects.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Luna Eclipsed":say:Luna Eclipsed. Dear Princess Celestia, When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem - your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even though somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Sisterhooves Social":say:Sisterhooves Social. Havin' a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest. I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty. A lot dirty.  A little bit dirty. A lot dirty. A little bit dirty! Hold it, hold it! How about "a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right"? Deal!
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: The Cutie Pox":say:The Cutie Pox. Dear Princess Celestia, Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself, and others. And that's something every heart desires.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: May the Best Pet Win!":say:May the Best Pet Win! Dear Princess Celestia, I used to think the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was. Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude -- that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: The Mysterious Mare Do Well":say:The Mysterious Mare Do Well. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me.

Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit. I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Secret of My Excess":say:Secret of My Excess. Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Baby Cakes":say:Baby Cakes. Dear Princess Celestia, I've always had fun playing with little kids and I thought babysitting them is just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate, and today I learned that sometimes, our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: The Last Roundup":say:The Last Roundup. Dear Princess Celestia, It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000":say:The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000. Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to share my thoughts with you.  I didn't learn anything! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure, I could tell you I learned somethin' about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already, too.

But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship. No pony can force two ponies to be together. It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: A Friend in Deed":say:A Friend in Deed. Dear Princess Celestia, There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Putting Your Hoof Down":say:Putting Your Hoof Down. Dear Princess Celestia, Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself. When I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became, but I learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean.

Dear Princess Celestia, Seeing the Great Dragon Migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon, but now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends had taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true. I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family. Yours truly, Spike
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: Hurricane Fluttershy":say:Hurricane Fluttershy. Dear Princess Celestia, Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contributions is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best and believe in yourself, anything can happen.

To the citizens of Ponyville, for a while now, you've been reading this column to get the latest dirt and the hottest buzz. But this will be my final piece. We want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused. You see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo. As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing. From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more. All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville. Signing off for the very last time, XOXO, Gabby Gums.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 2",title="Friendship lesson: MMMystery on the Friendship Express":say:MMMystery on the Friendship Express. Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned it's not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings. And it could make you feel really foolish. So from now on, I will make sure to always get all the facts.

You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own.

Dear Princess Celestia, It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long. Respectfully yours, Pinkie Pie
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 3",title="Friendship lesson: One Bad Apple":say:One Bad Apple. You see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully. Then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan. And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?! Guess what we're trying to say is... We're sorry.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 3",title="Friendship lesson: Apple Family Reunion":say:Apple Family Reunion. Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you think about it, is the first group of friends you ever met. Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the who long after you've forgotten the what. Your humble subject, Applejack
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 3",title="Friendship lesson: Spike at Your Service":say:Spike at Your Service.  if something like this comes up in the future, think maybe we could go back to my code—say, "That's what friends do"—and leave it at that?
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 3",title="Friendship lesson: Keep Calm and Flutter On":say:Keep Calm and Flutter On. I guess when you're friends you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh? By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose. Alright. Friendship is magic.

The magic of friendship doesn't just exist in Equestria, it's everywhere. You can seek it out. Or you can forever be alone. The choice is yours. A true princess in any world leads not by forcing others to bow before her, but by inspiring others to stand with her.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Princess Twilight Sparkle":say:Princess Twilight Sparkle. You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Castle Mane-ia":say:Castle Mane-ia. Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you. Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Daring Don't":say:Daring Don't. Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Flight to the Finish":say:Flight to the Finish. You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing because it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Power Ponies":say:Power Ponies. We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Bats!":say:Bats! You shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something you don't think is right. Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends "no".
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Rarity Takes Manehattan":say:Rarity Takes Manehattan. Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Pinkie Pride":say:Pinkie Pride. You're both super duper party ponies.

annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Simple Ways":say:Simple Ways. Organizing the Ponyville Days Celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson: real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Filli Vanilli":say:Filli Vanilli. Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love. But hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Twilight Time":say:Twilight Time. I guess Twilight must not be so super upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities mixed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special: because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new. That's the kind of magic I really wanna get good at...now that I'm getting so good at the other kind. We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal...Well, almost back to normal.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: It Ain't Easy Being Breezies":say:It Ain't Easy Being Breezies. My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms. And, sometimes, being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Somepony to Watch Over Me":say:Somepony to Watch Over Me. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out. Yes! Now that is the kind of looking out for me I can definitely appreciate.

Being honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believing a lie can end up hurting them even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that – but I sure ain't one of them.
annotate:artist="My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic",album="Season 4",title="Friendship lesson: Testing Testing 1, 2, 3":say:Testing Testing 1, 2, 3. Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts. But she's not the only pony that needed a lesson. I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual.
